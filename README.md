# Predicting-Stock-Prices-With-Financial-News

Can we use the content of news analytics to predict stock price performance? The ubiquity of data today enables investors at any scale to make better investment decisions. The challenge is ingesting and interpreting the data to determine which data is useful, finding the signal in this sea of information. We have used Neural Networks for predicting Apple and Microsoft Stock Prices, feeding our LSTM Network both with the sentiment of Financial News refering the stock and the previous days stock prices. We suggest the following models to combat the above project:


- LSTM with Finbert Sentiment Analysis
- LSTM with Finbert Word Embedding 
- LSTM with stock prices and Sentiment Score 


Finally we compare the above implementation with ARIMA and make some predictions.
